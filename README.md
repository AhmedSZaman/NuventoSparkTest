- **Scala and Spark Data Transformation**
  <ul>
    <li>Overview: Developed a robust data transformation and processing pipeline using Scala and Apache Spark, focusing on efficiency and scalability.</li>
    <li>Objective: Designed to handle batch processing tasks involving the extraction, transformation, and storage of large datasets.</li>
    <li>Implementation: Utilized Apache Spark for its powerful data processing capabilities, transforming raw data and saving the output as optimized Parquet files. Employed an MVC format to encapsulate and organize the code, ensuring maintainability and modularity.</li>
    <li>Features: The project involved creating a very basic banking system in the Scala console, showcasing advanced data processing techniques, including reading multiple data sources, performing complex transformations, and efficiently writing the results to storage.</li>
    <li>Outcome: Delivered a scalable and efficient data processing solution, capable of handling large volumes of data with ease, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.</li>
  </ul>
